-- Module:      $Header$
-- Description: A work in progress client implementation of RFC 6120 (XMPP:
--              Core).
-- License:     Apache License 2.0
--
-- Maintainer:  jon.kristensen@nejla.com
-- Stability:   unstable
-- Portability: portable
--
-- The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology
-- for near-real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications
-- including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video
-- calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and
-- generalized routing of XML data. XMPP provides a technology for the
-- asynchronous, end-to-end exchange of structured data by means of direct,
-- persistent XML streams among a distributed network of globally addressable,
-- presence-aware clients and servers.
--
-- Pontarius is an XMPP client library, implementing the core capabilities of
-- XMPP (RFC 6120): setup and teardown of XML streams, channel encryption,
-- authentication, error handling, and communication primitives for messaging.
--
-- Note that we are not recommending anyone to use Pontarius XMPP at this time
-- as it's still in an experimental stage and will have its API and data types
-- modified frequently.

  -- * JID
  -- | A JID (historically: Jabber ID) is XMPPs native format
  -- for addressing entities in the network. It is somewhat similar to an e-mail
  -- address but contains three parts instead of two:
  , Jid(..)
  , isBare
  , isFull
  -- * Stanzas
  -- | The basic protocol data unit in XMPP is the XML stanza. The stanza is
  -- essentially a fragment of XML that is sent over a stream. @Stanzas@ come in
  -- 3 flavors:
  --
  --  * @'Message'@, for traditional push-style message passing between peers
  --
  --  * @'Presence'@, for communicating status updates
  --
  --  * IQ (info/query), for request-response semantics communication
  --
  -- All stanza types have the following attributes in common:
  --
  --  * The /id/ attribute is used by the originating entity to track any
  --    response or error stanza that it might receive in relation to the
  --    generated stanza from another entity (such as an intermediate server or
  --    the intended recipient).  It is up to the originating entity whether the
  --    value of the 'id' attribute is unique only within its current stream or
  --    unique globally.
  --
  --  * The /from/ attribute specifies the JID of the sender.
  --
  --  * The /to/ attribute specifies the JID of the intended recipient for the
  --    stanza.
  --
  --  * The /type/ attribute specifies the purpose or context of the message,
  --    presence, or IQ stanza. The particular allowable values for the 'type'
  --    attribute vary depending on whether the stanza is a message, presence,
  --    or IQ stanza.

  -- ** Messages
  -- | The /message/ stanza is a /push/ mechanism whereby one entity pushes
  -- information to another entity, similar to the communications that occur in
  -- a system such as email.

  -- ** Presence
  -- | XMPP includes the ability for an entity to advertise its network
  -- availability, or "presence", to other entities. In XMPP, this availability
  -- for communication is signaled end-to-end by means of a dedicated
  -- communication primitive: the presence stanza.

  -- *** creating
  , module Network.Xmpp.Presence
  -- *** sending
  -- | Sends a presence stanza. In general, the presence stanza should have no
  -- 'to' attribute, in which case the server to which the client is connected
  -- will broadcast that stanza to all subscribed entities. However, a
  -- publishing client may also send a presence stanza with a 'to' attribute, in
  -- which case the server will route or deliver that stanza to the intended
  -- recipient.

  -- *** receiving
  , pullPresence
  , waitForPresence
  -- ** IQ
  -- | Info\/Query, or IQ, is a /request-response/ mechanism, similar in some
  -- ways to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol @HTTP@. The semantics of IQ enable
  -- an entity to make a request of, and receive a response from, another
  -- entity. The data content and precise semantics  of the request and response
  -- is defined by the schema or other structural definition associated with the
  -- XML namespace that qualifies the direct child element of the IQ element. IQ
  -- interactions follow a common pattern of structured data exchange such as
  -- get/result or set/result (although an error can be returned in reply to a
  -- request if appropriate)
